This is the README of my script. 
What does this program? 
- it can Stop ETS2 exactly 3.5 seconds, after running the program. I programmed it, because some people on Truckers MP are *not so nice*. With this program, you stop ETS2 for some time, and then resume the process. So the person which is annoying you, will crash into you, and you can just drive on.

Why? 
- I was bored, and some Scout Driver Really annoyed me by crashing into me for some time. After I finally could overtake them, a script like this would have been very good, for getting rid of them. 
- After countless same Situations, I decided to program this script. 
A Couple Years ago I already had a script like this, which was written as a batch file, but it got lost when I nuked my Nextcloud. 

How do I use it? 
- You can use any Hotkey Program, to bind a Keyboard - Combination to open this Program
- You can use Razer Synapse (or probably your Program of your Keyboard) to open this program. 

Windows Defender says it is a Virus. 
- I know, it is because the Program runs in the background when opened, and no Windows opens. If I program it to open a Window, it would minimize ETS2, which would make no sense while playing. 
I will probably NOT give this another release, because I just added an Exception in Windows Defender, so it doesn't warn me every time I turn on my PC. 

 Disclaimer: 
 If you get banned using this, it will be on your own responsibility. Also, please don't use this program for fun, so random people get crashed. Use it only for idiot People, and Scout drivers who are crashing other Trucks.
